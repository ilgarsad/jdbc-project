    ROWNUM
        It limits the number of row result displayed in the query

-- display first 5 highest salary employees information in the company

-- BAD PRACTICE -- This following query splits / LIMITS the table and then sorts.

where ROWNUM < 6;


-- display first 52 highest salary employees information in the company

--WITH SALARY DUPLICATE - STILL NOT GOOD PRACTICE
-- Display all information from employees who is making 5th highest salary
select min(salary) from (select * from EMPLOYEES order by SALARY desc)
where ROWNUM < 6; -- 13500

select * from EMPLOYEES
where SALARY = 13500;

-- to make it dynamic
select * from EMPLOYEES
where SALARY = (select min(salary) from (select * from EMPLOYEES order by SALARY desc)

-- GOOD PRACTICE - we need to remove the duplicates and then split/limit the table then get the min salary
